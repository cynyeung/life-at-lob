# Marketing Developer Assignment Overview
## The Goal
The goal of this assignment is for our team to assess your attention to detail, as well as your front-end chops.


## Project Details
- Translate this [figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/88oRMWaJ1Ib5Y1Vf0m1WA8/Marketing-Developer-Take-Home-Assignment?node-id=0%3A1) design mock as if it were a section of a landing page.
	- Within copy, link Webflow to their [101 crash course page](https://university.webflow.com/courses/webflow-101-crash-course). Style the link as a ‚ÄúStandard Link‚Äù according to our [digital style guide](https://www.lob.com/style-guide).
	- On both hover and click, have What does Lob value? dropdown roll out of button, mimicking "Scale Down" animation [found here](https://codinhood.com/micro/10-dropdown-menu-animations-css-transform).
	- All graphics can be found [in this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1toKgWeBKr7VxrfaIecQsKWX6Mmch_niu?usp=sharing).

	- Treat yourself to a nice walk around the block and have a lovely rest of the day! üôÇ

## Dev Notes
- Completed with mobile-first approach
- Mimicked dropdown option hover state from [Lob digital style guide](https://www.lob.com/style-guide)
- Bugfix: On iOS, double-tap is expected behavior to trigger click event. There's no true JS method to detect for device type. Instead, I found and updated to an alternative solution to detect for platform. Now hover events trigger only for non-iOS platforms to avoid double-tapping to expand dropdown.

### Additional Features
- Scroll page smoothly back up when dropdown is collapsed
	- Added smooth scrolling polyfill for Safari support
- Adaptive design support for medium viewport widths between Figma designs for iPhone8 and Macbook
- Include metadata for favicon
